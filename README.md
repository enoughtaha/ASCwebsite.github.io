Here is a small sample website developed in simple HTML/CSS/JS (including JQuery libraries). It has the potential to be used as a personal/portfolio website, and was created with a desktop view in mind. This project was made as a demonstration of a website with a "retro video game" theme, with no intention of being completed as a full-fledged visual website.
